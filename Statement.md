Project Overview: Movie Recommender 

This document outlines the basic features of the Simple Content-Based Movie Recommendation System.
Feature :
    1. Movie Recommendation System (CLI): 
       Problem Statement - Users experience "choice paralysis" or feel overwhelmed and spend a considerable amount of time browsing streaming libraries before 
       simply reverting to their watched content. Therefore, the identified gap here is the need for a specific and targeted filter that reduces the friction here. 
    2. Project Scope: 
       Project implementation will focus directly on Content-Based Filtering logic, which will use static in memory (i.e., piped in on the command line) genre data
       and the similarity scores;
       an embed code or code that consumes an external APIs, persistent storage, user profiles or other graphical interface is out of scope for this scope. 
    3. Target Users: 
      Users for the movie recommendation system are somewhat representative of students and developers who are currently learning about recommendation algorithms
      - or simpler implementations that are easy to trace, and just demonstrations - i.e., useful to students or in front of audiences - other demonstration can 
      simply indicate genre of movies that are similar.
    4. Hight-Level Features: 
      Genre Similarity Scoring: Rank order movie adaptations based on genre overlap. 
      CLI Interface: Simple input/output interaction through command line. 
      Simple Error Handling - Notifies user if movie is not found.
